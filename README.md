            <h2>How I Started Coding in High School</h2>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-02-16">February 16, 2025</time></p>
            <div>
                <p>When I first started high school, I didn’t know much about coding. I was more focused on
                subjects like math and science, but everything changed when I took my first computer science class.
                </p>

                <p>The class was an introduction to programming, and we started learning Python. At first, it felt 
                overwhelming—there were so many concepts to grasp, like variables, loops, and functions. But once I 
                started experimenting and writing my own code, things started to click. I realized that coding was not
                just about writing lines of text, but about problem-solving and creating something useful.</p>

                <p>One of the most exciting projects I worked on was a simple game that we built using Python. I had 
                never thought I could create something interactive, and seeing the game come together was a huge 
                confidence booster. After that, I knew I wanted to keep learning and eventually pursue a career in 
                software engineering.</p>

                <p>Since then, I’ve been learning more about coding through online tutorials, projects, and challenges. 
                Now, I’m exploring other languages like JavaScript and working on building my own website. I can’t wait 
                to see where this journey takes me!</p>

                <p>So, if you're thinking about learning to code, my advice is to start small and be patient with 
                yourself. You won’t master everything overnight, but with practice, you'll get better and gain more 
                confidence with each project.</p>
